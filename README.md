In Java, arrays and ArrayLists are essential data structures used for storing and manipulating collections of elements, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

Arrays in Java are fixed in size once they are initialized. They allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays can be simple, one-dimensional structures or complex multi-dimensional types. For example, an integer array can hold multiple integers, and its size must be defined at the time of declaration. This can lead to memory inefficiency if the size is underestimated or wasted space if overestimated. Additionally, accessing elements in an array is straightforward, as you can directly reference an index.

On the other hand, ArrayLists are part of the Java Collections Framework and provide more flexibility. They are dynamic in nature, meaning that their size can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed. This makes them more versatile for scenarios where the number of elements is not known ahead of time. ArrayLists also offer built-in methods for manipulation, like adding, removing, and searching for elements, enhancing usability. However, they can incur some performance overhead compared to arrays because they involve additional object overhead and possible resizing operations.



import java.util.ArrayList;

public class DifferenceArraysArrayLists {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Array example
        int[] array = new int[5]; // fixed size array
        array[0] = 10;
        array[1] = 20;
        array[2] = 30;

        System.out.println("Array Elements:");
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(array[i]); // accessing elements by index
        }

        // ArrayList example
        ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>(); // dynamic size ArrayList
        arrayList.add(10); // adding elements
        arrayList.add(20);
        arrayList.add(30);

        System.out.println("ArrayList Elements:");
        for (Integer element : arrayList) {
            System.out.println(element); // using enhanced for loop
        }

        // Show the size difference
        System.out.println("Array Length: " + array.length);
        System.out.println("ArrayList Size: " + arrayList.size());
    }
}
